# hello-world
this is a tutorial for using github

now I am doing some changes, because the tutorial told me to.
I try to get a little bit more into programming with the final goal of creating an app with a friend of mine.
he already did some courses, e.g. a github course, so now I am trying to cut the distance.


add some new line
